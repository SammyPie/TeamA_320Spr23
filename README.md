### Project Idea ###

Currently, UMass students use Spireâ€™s schedule builder to select classes for their following semester. Our team hopes to create an improved schedule builder that considers a wider range of student commitments. The scheduling tool will unify classes, clubs, exams, jobs, and other personal activities. It will also consider the locations and priority of each commitment to generate a recommended schedule for users. The scheduling tool will be utilized by UMass students and club leaders.


### Features ###

The product will have multiple features for students and/or club leaders to use. Students will be able to input their potential classes/clubs, exam dates, and work schedule. Our databases will include the times and locations of classes and clubs. The tool will also interact with the input data from users and club leaders.
